Bugs:
  - $_GET is not cleaned in swap_floppies.php
  - Some files in the fandal archive contain 'invalid' characters, resulting in weird output
  - Loaded images are still part of the active slider, even if from other html file.

Nice to haves:
  - Add touch support (mobile)
  - Create new floppies (SD/DD/..)
  - PCLink support (Drag folders)
